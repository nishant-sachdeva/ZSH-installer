# ZSH-installer
A simple script to set up basic zsh on your linux terminal


1. Clone the directory into your local machine.
2. cd into the directory that you just cloned into.
3. Run the install_zsh.sh script to install and set up basic zsh

4. This script also makes zsh your default shell and you'll have to relaunch your terminal to observe that.
( ps: if you do not want zsh to be your default shell, comment out the line " chsh -s /bin/zsh")
